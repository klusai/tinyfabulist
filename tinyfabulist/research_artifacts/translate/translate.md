## üìù Translation Evaluation: Fables (EN ‚Üí RO)

### üîç What This Is
We're evaluating Romanian translations of English fables using a structured rubric. The goal is to assess how well the translation conveys the **meaning, tone, fluency, and moral** of the original text. This helps us ensure high-quality translations that remain faithful to the source while sounding natural in Romanian.

Each evaluation outputs a **JSON object** with scores and explanations, which can be used for consistency, feedback, or even training purposes.
