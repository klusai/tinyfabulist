    fable: |
      Create a fable based on the following elements. Weave them naturally into a story:
        - Main Character: a {{trait}} {{character}}
        - Setting: a {{setting}} where our story unfolds
        - Challenge: {{conflict}}
        - Outcome: {{resolution}}
        - Teaching: {{moral}}
      The fable should:
        - Be appropriate for age group B (4-7 years)
        - Use simple vocabulary that 4-7 year olds can understand
        - Use concrete rather than abstract language
        - Begin with vivid scene-setting
        - Not use names for the characters, instead use the trait and character
        - Include meaningful but simple dialogue
        - Show (don't tell) the character's growth
        - End with a clear connection to the moral
      Keep the story concise but engaging, around 250 words.
