Feral, known for his untamed spirit, had been provoked by a misguided act of revenge by a rival, a scatterbrained donkey named Scatter.\n\n\n\"I've been wronged, and I'll have my day in the sun!\" bragged Scatter, unaware of the consequences. He had stolen the only trophy the group valued, a lustrous golden horn.\n\n\nFeral's heart was set on exacting his own punishment. He grazed around the warehouse, nudging the pieces of the trophy with his snout until he finally decided to claim it as his own.\n\n\nHowever, as Feral attempted to take the horn, the rest of the group, a diverse herd of creatures, gathered around. They murmured amongst themselves, their voices a cacophony of concern.\n\n\n\"Feral, you know better. This is not the way,\" warned the wise old elephant, his wrinkled face soft with wisdom.\n\n\nAn argument bred confusion as each felt justified in their stance. Feral, blinded by his wrath, failed to see the harm he caused until the herd confronted him.\n\n\n\"Let's have a vote. What's fair to all?\" suggested the gazelle, her voice clear and calm.\n\n\nAfter much deliberation, it was decided that Feral would apologize and return the horn. Scatter, to make amends, promised to find a new trophy for them to cherish.\n\n\nFeral learned that day to temper his fiery heart with reason. He realized that open-mindedness had prevented further conflict within the herd. Their unity, once threatened by misguided vengeance, was restored through mutual respect and the courage to confront one's mistakes.\n\n\nAnd so, the moral was clear: open-mindedness is the olive branch that heals the wounds of misunderstanding and conflict.", "llm_name": "microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct ", "llm_input_tokens": null, "llm_output_tokens": null, "llm_inference_time": 35.10093545913696, "host_provider": "endpoints.huggingface", "host_dc_provider": "eu-west-1", "host_dc_location": "eu-west-1", "host_gpu": "Nvidia A10G", "host_gpu_vram": 24, "host_cost_per_hour": 1.0, "generation_datetime": "2025-04-01 10:18:05", "pipeline_version": "1.0"}
