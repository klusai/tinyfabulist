True power lies not in influence, but in the understanding of the greater good.\" The fish, humbled by their words, realized that she had strayed from her path.\n\nTogether, the fish and the turtles formed a new council, one that brought together the cavern's diverse inhabitants to address issues and work towards a common goal.
