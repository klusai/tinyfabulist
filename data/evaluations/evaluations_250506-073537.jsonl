Here, in this harsh yet beautiful place, a mighty lion ruled over the animals. This lion, vast and powerful, had an unyielding hunger that never seemed to be satisfied. \n\nOur lion, let's call him Roga, roamed the savanna, his golden mane gleaming in the sunlight. He was a force to be reckoned with, feared by all who crossed his path. Yet, beneath his fierce exterior, there was a darkness that plagued him. A constant hunger, not for food, but for something far more fragile and precious. \n\nOne day, as Roga lay in the heat of the afternoon, a small rabbit, no bigger than his paw, hopped into view. The rabbit, with its fluffy ears and big eyes, seemed unaware of the lion's presence. It hopped closer, curious and unafraid, until it was within reaching distance. \n\nRoga, startled by the rabbit's bravery, sat up, his massive body swaying. With a swift movement, he pounced, his claws slicing through the air. The rabbit, quick as lightning, darted away, its tiny heart pounding. \n\nFor the first time, Roga felt a strange sense of dissatisfaction. The rabbit's fear had excited him, but it was not the thrill of a successful hunt that he desired. It was something more... protective. \n\nDeciding to continue his pursuit, Roga chased the rabbit across the savanna. The rabbit, though fast, could not outrun the lion's relentless pursuit. Finally, cornered by the mighty predator, the rabbit stopped, its little heart pounding in its tiny chest. \n\nRoga, now within arm's reach, stopped short. The rabbit, eyes wide with fear, looked up at the lion. Instead of the expected pounce, Roga bent down, his massive body lowering to the ground. With gentle, deliberate movements, he surrounded the rabbit with his body, protecting it from any harm. \n\nThe rabbit, startled by the lion's unusual behavior, stopped quivering. It looked up at Roga, and for the first time, the lion felt a sense of calm. It was then that Roga realized the true nature of his power: the ability to protect and keep safe those who could not defend themselves. \n\nFrom that day on, Roga the lion was known not only for his strength but also for his unwavering protection of the weak. He had found his true strength in his ability to guard and serve, and this, above all, brought him peace. \n\nThe moral of this tale is clear: true strength lies not in dominance but in the power to protect and care for others, for it is in this act of service that we find our greatest strength and purpose.", "llm_name": "CohereForAI/aya-23-8B", "llm_input_tokens": 131, "llm_output_tokens": 591, "llm_inference_time": 86.51627779006958, "host_provider": "endpoints.huggingface", "host_dc_provider": "eu-west-1", "host_dc_location": "eu-west-1", "host_gpu": "Nvidia A10G", "host_gpu_vram": 24, "host_cost_per_hour": 1.0, "generation_datetime": "2025-03-06 11:31:02", "pipeline_version": "1.0", "evaluation": {"type": "Fable Evaluation", "grammar": 8, "creativity": 6, "moral_clarity": 8, "adherence_to_prompt": 5, "best_age_group": "C", "explanation": ["The fable is written in clear, descriptive language with vivid scene-setting, though the informal insertion of a name diminishes its overall polished style.", "It employs a classic transformation trope in fables by showing a vicious lion become protective, but the lack of meaningful dialogue and reliance on a proper name reduce its originality.", "The moral is clearly stated and well-integrated, effectively emphasizing that true strength comes from protecting others.", "While the narrative includes several key elements from the prompt, it falls short by naming the lion instead of using trait-based descriptions and omitting any significant dialogue.", "The language complexity and narrative structure make it most suitable for readers aged 8-11 years (Age Group C), who can understand the moral while enjoying the descriptive style."]}, "input_file": "tinyfabulist/data/fables/aya-23-8b-kzw/tf_fables_aya-23-8b-kzw_dt250306-112934.jsonl", "pipeline_stage": "evaluation", "evaluator_model": "o3-mini-2025-01-31", "evaluation_timestamp": "2025-05-06 07:35:37"}

She was known for her speed and keen eyesight, always keeping a watchful eye on the village. Swift took great pride in her ability to spot any potential danger, be it a rogue wave or a stray shark. \n\nOne sunny day, a group of children were playing near the shore, casting their lines into the water. Their laughter and playful chatter filled the air. Unbeknownst to them, one curious child, in an impulsivity moment, cast their line a little too eagerly and it snared around the leg of Swift, who was walking nearby. \n\n\"Oh, dear ostrich!\" exclaimed the child, their voice filled with remorse. \"I am so sorry! Please, forgive me!\" The other children gathered, their eyes wide with concern. \n\nSwift, startled and a little frustrated, let out a sharp \"quack!\" of surprise and then a more relaxed \"rumm-a-dum\" to assure them she was unharmed. She knew the children meant no harm, and their apology was sincere. \n\n\"It's quite all right, young ones,\" she said, her voice as calm as the sea. \"Accidents happen, and I understand. But I think we can all agree that I should be more careful in the future. Let's just be more mindful, shall we?\" \n\nThe children nodded, and the village buzzed with talk of the incident. Some blamed the child, saying that more care should be taken. But Swift, with her wise and calm demeanor, reminded everyone that accidents happen and that justice should not be swift or hasty. \n\n\"We must all learn from our mistakes,\" she said, her voice carrying across the village. \"And remember, we are all part of this community, and community means taking care of each other.\" \n\nThe village heeded her words, and a sense of unity and understanding settled over them. The child who had accidentally snared Swift's leg was welcomed back with open arms, and the incident became a reminder of the value of forgiveness and compassion. \n\nAnd so, the village continued to thrive, a testament to the power of unity and the value of taking care, no matter how small the act. \n\nMoral: Justice and compassion serve all, and unity is a powerful bond.", "llm_name": "CohereForAI/aya-23-8B", "llm_input_tokens": 133, "llm_output_tokens": 532, "llm_inference_time": 165.64317655563354, "host_provider": "endpoints.huggingface", "host_dc_provider": "eu-west-1", "host_dc_location": "eu-west-1", "host_gpu": "Nvidia A10G", "host_gpu_vram": 24, "host_cost_per_hour": 1.0, "generation_datetime": "2025-03-06 11:32:21", "pipeline_version": "1.0", "evaluation": {"type": "Fable Evaluation", "grammar": 8, "creativity": 6, "moral_clarity": 7, "adherence_to_prompt": 6, "best_age_group": "C", "explanation": ["The fable is written in clear, accessible language with only minor awkward expressions, earning an 8 for grammar and style.", "Its setting and use of a bold ostrich add interest, but the narrative follows familiar fable patterns, resulting in a creativity score of 6.", "The moral is stated clearly and ties into the narrative, though the connection to justice is only moderately developed, which warrants a score of 7.", "While the story features vivid scene-setting and dialogue, it falls short by naming the ostrich and not fully showing character growth, leading to a 6 for adherence to the prompt.", "The vocabulary, sentence structure, and overall narrative length are best suited for children aged 8-11, corresponding to age group C."]}, "input_file": "tinyfabulist/data/fables/aya-23-8b-kzw/tf_fables_aya-23-8b-kzw_dt250306-112934.jsonl", "pipeline_stage": "evaluation", "evaluator_model": "o3-mini-2025-01-31", "evaluation_timestamp": "2025-05-06 07:35:37"}

The Wolf could almost taste the sweetness of the fruits that hung from the palm trees.\n\nBut as it drew closer, a sense of unease crept over the Wolf. Its keen senses detected the scent of something else—the faint, but distinct, aroma of smoke and burning embers. The Wolf's heart quickened as it realized that something was amiss.\n\nUpon reaching the oasis, the Wolf discovered a group of travelers huddled around a small, flickering campfire. Their faces, illuminated by the dancing flames, were etched with worry and fatigue. One of them, a wise-looking old man, noticed the Wolf and beckoned to it.\n\n\"Young wolf,\" he said, his voice carrying a hint of warmth despite the cool desert breeze, \"we are travelers from a distant land, seeking solace and refreshment in this desert. But our supplies are running low, and we have not forgotten the dangers that lurk in these sands. Will you join us by the fire and share what food you have?\"\n\nThe Wolf's heart was torn. Its instinct to protect and its desire to honor the travelers' hospitality clashed within it. But something about the travelers' weary expressions spoke to a deeper need—a need for companionship and a shared burden.\n\nThe Wolf decided to trust and share. It approached the fire and offered what it could—a few fresh fruits, a small game it had hunted, and a bundle of herbs it had gathered. The travelers' faces lit up with gratitude and relief.\n\nAs the Wolf sat by the fire, it felt a sense of contentment and connection. It realized that sometimes, the path of loyalty and honesty may be challenging, but it always leads to rewarding outcomes.\n\nThe moral of the fable: \"Honesty and loyalty are the keys to building strong connections and overcoming challenges. Trust and openheartedness can lead to mutual support and a path to prosperity.\"", "llm_name": "CohereForAI/aya-23-8B", "llm_input_tokens": 129, "llm_output_tokens": 481, "llm_inference_time": 197.31098866462708, "host_provider": "endpoints.huggingface", "host_dc_provider": "eu-west-1", "host_dc_location": "eu-west-1", "host_gpu": "Nvidia A10G", "host_gpu_vram": 24, "host_cost_per_hour": 1.0, "generation_datetime": "2025-03-06 11:32:52", "pipeline_version": "1.0", "evaluation": {"type": "Fable Evaluation", "grammar": 8, "creativity": 6, "moral_clarity": 8, "adherence_to_prompt": 6, "best_age_group": "C", "explanation": ["The fable features a generally polished and descriptive narrative with only minor errors (e.g., a misspelling) that do not hinder understanding.", "While the desert imagery and meaningful dialogue add originality, the narrative misses the clear incorporation of the 'stealing food' challenge as specified in the prompt.", "The moral is clearly stated and meaningful, reinforcing that honesty is the best policy, though the presentation of the character's transformation could be deeper.", "The story adheres to many prompt requirements like vivid scene-setting and dialogue, yet it overlooks the explicit challenge of stealing food, slightly reducing its alignment.", "The vocabulary, sentence structure, and themes are best suited for children aged 8-11, making the fable accessible without oversimplifying the moral lesson."]}, "input_file": "tinyfabulist/data/fables/aya-23-8b-kzw/tf_fables_aya-23-8b-kzw_dt250306-112934.jsonl", "pipeline_stage": "evaluation", "evaluator_model": "o3-mini-2025-01-31", "evaluation_timestamp": "2025-05-06 07:35:37"}

She often boasted to any creature who would listen about her superior appearance and how she was above all the other creatures in the valley. \n\nOne day, as Plat sunbathed by the pond, she spotted a group of curious rabbits approaching. They seemed to be on a quest for knowledge and adventure. Intrigued, Plat decided to engage them, hoping to use these new friends to enhance her reputation. \n\n\"Ho, there, my furry friends!\" she called out, flapping her tail gently. \"What brings you to this tranquil pond on such a fine day?\" \n\nThe rabbits, led by a wise old bunny named Sage, smiled politely. \"We are on a journey of self-discovery,\" Sage replied. \"We seek to understand the true nature of beauty and the essence of our own identities. We have heard of your reputation, O great Plat, and wonder if you might offer us insight.\" \n\nPlat's tail puffed with pride, and she straightened her bill with a sense of satisfaction. \"Ah, young rabbits,\" she began, \"your quest is a noble one. But let me tell you, true beauty lies not in the eyes of others, but in the eyes of the beholder—yourself. Each of us is unique, and it is our differences that make us beautiful.\" \n\nAs the conversation continued, Plat's words began to sink in. She noticed a hint of doubt in the rabbits' expressions, and her heart, once so proud, now felt light and free. Perhaps her quest for approval had been in vain, and it was time to embrace a new path. \n\nThe rabbits bid their farewell, and as they departed, Sage turned to Plat with a kind smile. \"Remember, dear Plat, that it is not our external appearance that defines us, but the kindness and acceptance we show to others.\" \n\nAnd so, with a newfound sense of peace, Plat continued her days, no longer seeking validation from others but instead spreading kindness and embracing the unique beauty of herself and all the creatures in the valley. \n\nMoral: Embracing our true selves and offering kindness to others reveals the beauty that lies within.", "llm_name": "CohereForAI/aya-23-8B", "llm_input_tokens": 134, "llm_output_tokens": 488, "llm_inference_time": 268.7648997306824, "host_provider": "endpoints.huggingface", "host_dc_provider": "eu-west-1", "host_dc_location": "eu-west-1", "host_gpu": "Nvidia A10G", "host_gpu_vram": 24, "host_cost_per_hour": 1.0, "generation_datetime": "2025-03-06 11:34:04", "pipeline_version": "1.0", "evaluation": {"type": "Fable Evaluation", "grammar": 9, "creativity": 7, "moral_clarity": 8, "adherence_to_prompt": 6, "best_age_group": "C", "explanation": ["The fable is written in clear, polished language with few grammatical issues, making it easy to follow.", "The narrative is inventive by featuring a platypus as a central figure, although using proper names instead of solely descriptive traits detracts slightly from its originality.", "The moral is presented effectively through the character’s journey from conceit to kindness, even if it deviates somewhat from the specific theme of second chances.", "While the story meets many of the prompt requirements such as vivid scene-setting, meaningful dialogue, and demonstrated character growth, it falls short by naming characters and extending beyond the suggested word count.", "The language and thematic complexity make this fable most appropriate for children aged 8-11, ensuring the lesson is engaging yet understandable for that age group."]}, "input_file": "tinyfabulist/data/fables/aya-23-8b-kzw/tf_fables_aya-23-8b-kzw_dt250306-112934.jsonl", "pipeline_stage": "evaluation", "evaluator_model": "o3-mini-2025-01-31", "evaluation_timestamp": "2025-05-06 07:35:37"}

My friend, come quick!

They shared stories of their travels, introducing Kalu to new sights and experiences.\n\nAs the days passed, Kalu discovered a world beyond his wildest dreams.

No longer afraid, Kalu realized that his fear had been holding him back from forging meaningful connections and understanding.\n\nThrough forgiveness and a willingness to explore, Kalu and his new friends shared in the island's beauty.

He continued to urge Donki to take risks, to explore hidden coves and deep-sea caves, always seeking excitement. Donki began to feel restless and a bit worried that Turbo would not respect his wishes. \n\nOne day, Turbo insisted that they compete in a race to the edge of the reef, beyond the familiar territories of Donki's home. Donki politely declined, explaining that he preferred to stay close to home and tend to his garden. \"Adventures are fun, but they should be chosen with care,\" he said. \n\nTurbo, understanding Donki's nature, smiled and said, \"You've shown me the beauty of caution and preparation.

With a swift kick, he knocked the sand away, revealing a sturdy, rusted chest. \n\nAs Red pried open the chest, the fish gasped. Inside, instead of gold and jewels, lay a single, weathered scroll, tied with a delicate ribbon. With trembling fins, a fish removed the scroll and passed it to Red. \n\n\"But... but this is not what we expected!\" Red spoke, his voice filled with confusion. \n\nThe fish exchanged worried glances.

Among the tall trees, a small mouse, timid and cautious, made her way down to the river's edge. She was an observer, always curious about the world around her, but today, she felt a sense of adventure stirring within her. \n\nAs she sat on a large rock, a group of larger creatures, the eagles and hawks, came into view, soaring above the trees.

We are the rulers of the sky, and no creature on land can match our strength and prowess.\" \n\nThe hawks, with their sharp talons and keen vision, nodded in agreement. \"We are the masters of this realm,\" one hawk proclaimed. \"Our eyes can spot prey from afar, and our sharp claws can bring down even the largest of foes.\" \n\nThe mouse, though small, felt a surge of pride within her. She knew she possessed her own unique skills and strengths, but she couldn't help but feel a little intimidated by the eagles and hawks' show of power. \n\nUnbeknownst to the birds, however, the mouse had a plan. Using her keen senses and agility, she began to gather small rocks and pebbles, secretly hiding them among the trees. \n\nAs the eagles and hawks prepared to take off once more, showing off their feathers and soaring high into the sky, the mouse put her plan into action. With swift and silent movements, she placed the hidden rocks beneath their path, just out of sight. \n\nThe eagles and hawks, proud and overconfident, did not anticipate the mouse's cunning trap. As they soared back to the riverbank, their mighty wings flapping, they stumbled upon the hidden rocks. Their paws slipped, and they tumbled down from their high perch, landing in a heap on the ground. \n\nThe mouse, with a mischievous glint in her eyes, watched as the proud eagles and hawks scrambled to their feet, feeling the stinging embarrassment of their fall. \n\nThe Moral: Unity, in all its forms, is stronger than division.

One of their own, a creature that had once been their friend, had turned against them, stealing their trust and causing division.\n\n\"How can we ever reconcile when one of our own has brought such harm?\" one of them whispered, their eyes filled with sorrow.\n\nMysteria, with her innate curiosity, yearned to understand. \"Why have you come to this place of despair? I sense a deep wound within your hearts.\"\n\nTheir leader, a wise old owl, shared their story. \"Long ago, our heart was as pure as the sun's rays. But greed and ambition clouded our judgment, and one among us sought power beyond that of the gods themselves. They betrayed our trust and stole the very essence of who we are. We were left divided, unable to find harmony within our own ranks.\"\n\nAs Mysteria listened, her heart ached for their pain. She knew that true strength lay not in division but in balance—a harmony between light and shadow, action and inaction.\n\nIn that moment, Mysteria made a promise. \"I will help you heal, but it will take courage and a willingness to confront the truth.\"\n\nAnd so, Mysteria embarked on a journey of discovery and reconciliation, facing her own fears along the way.

Sealean's once-vibrant movements became rigid and mechanical. She performed her routines without the spark of joy that had once illuminated her eyes. The gulls and crabs, sensing her turmoil, gathered in silence, their beaks tucked beneath their wings. \n\nDisturbed by this turn of events, Sealean sought guidance from an ancient seal sage who dwelled in a distant cave. \"What has brought this change?\" the sage asked, his voice carrying the wisdom of the ages. Sealean confided in him, \"I fear I have lost something essential in my pursuit of perfection. My movements are ruthless, but lacking in heart.\" \n\nThe seal sage shared an ancient text, its pages ancient and fragile. \"Perfection is not found in ruthless precision,\" he said. \"True mastery lies in the harmony of form and feeling. Embrace the imperfection of life, for it is in these irregularities that beauty and empathy are born.\" \n\nSealean's eyes widened as she read the words, and a gentle breeze carried the sand dunes' whispers of encouragement. She realized that her obsession had clouded her vision, and with a newfound sense of peace, she returned to the shore. \n\nFrom that day forward, Sealean's routines shone with a radiant spirit, and the audience once more erupted in joyful крики.

A group of shrimp had gathered, pointing and whispering in concern. In the center of their circle, a single shrimp stood out—a proud and confident creature, with a bright red shell and a haughty air. This was Red, and he had a reputation for being a troublemaker.\n\n\"Look at the mess he's made!\" exclaimed a small blue shrimp, her voice shaking with anger. \"He has ruined our peaceful spring with his careless actions!\"\n\nRed's eyes narrowed. \"I did no such thing!\" he sneered. \"It is they who are to blame for not understanding the power of my actions.

It was innocent and vulnerable, with no understanding of the chaos it had unintentionally caused.\n\n\"It is this tiny one who is to blame!\" Red shouted, his voice carrying across the pool. \"It is their lack of wisdom that has created this mess!\"\n\nFred felt a surge of indignation. He knew that Red was simply using the baby shrimp as a scapegoat, a convenient target to divert blame from himself. With a swift movement, Fred leaped forward and pushed himself between Red and the innocent baby.\n\n\"No!\" Fred declared. \"You are not to blame. It takes true wisdom to recognize innocence, and you, Red, lack that understanding.\"\n\nRed's face turned red with anger, but Fred stood firm, his small but powerful voice carrying across the spring. \"You are the troublemaker, Red. It is your actions that have caused this unrest. Leave this place in shame, and do not return until you have learned true integrity.\"\n\nAnd so, Red, humiliated and angry, departed the hot spring, his pride bruised and his actions exposed for all to see.

I have not meant to cause any harm or disrupt the peace of this wonderful forest.\" \n\nThe small creatures, their voices now carrying concern, asked, \"How can we be sure of your intentions? Your size and power are formidable, and we must protect our homes.\" \n\nThe rhino, its heart heavy with sorrow, realized the truth of their words. It had never considered how its very presence, so powerful and unlike their own, could be seen as a threat. \n\nFrom that day forward, the forest creatures established a new rule: all creatures, great and small, must gather at the cliffside each evening to share their stories, their fears, and their dreams. Thus, misunderstanding was avoided, and the forest thrived with a sense of community and mutual understanding. \n\nThe moral of this tale: ignorance breeds conflict.

She had never heard a creature speak with such courage and wit. \"Tell me, little rabbit,\" she said, \"what is this wisdom you speak of?\" The rabbit, knowing it was a risky move, replied, \"Wisdom is knowing when to ask for help. It is recognizing that true strength lies in unity and collaboration.\" Skittles' proud heart wavered. She thought of all the times she had refused aid, only to struggle later. \"You may have something there, little rabbit,\" she conceded.\n\nAs fate would have it, later that day, Skittles found herself in a tricky situation. She became entangled in some thick brambles, and no matter how hard she tried, she couldn't free herself. Just then, she heard a familiar voice from above her.

He spotted Howard and thought he'd make a perfect playmate, a challenge to his playful nature.\n\n\"Hey there, serious hippo!\" Dash called out, doing a quick spin and a dive, leaving a sparkly trail behind. \"Why are you so grumpy? It's a beautiful day, perfect for a game or a swim!\"\n\nHoward, taken aback by Dash's boldness, replied, \"I am not grumpy, young dolphin. I simply appreciate the beauty of this lagoon and the calm it brings. I am at peace here.\"\n\nBut Dash, undeterred, kept swimming circles around Howard, his playful giggles echoing through the water. \"C'mon, hippo! Live a little! Let's play a game of tag. You can't catch me, I'm too quick!\"\n\nAs Dash continued his playful pursuit, Howard felt his patience wear thin. \"I am not interested in playing your games, dolphin. I am at peace here, and I ask that you respect my space and the calm of this lagoon.\"\n\nDash, startled by Howard's stern tone, stopped and looked at the hippo with wide eyes. \"But... why? We're friends, right? Friends play together!\"\n\nHoward thought for a moment, his wise eyes softening. \"Friends do play together, but it is important to respect each other's needs and boundaries. I appreciate your energy and playful spirit, but sometimes quiet reflection is necessary for my soul.\"\n\n Dash, understanding Howard's request, swam back and forth, a playful frown on his fin. \"Okay, hippo. I get it. We can be friends who respect each other's space. But just so you know, I'm the fastest swimmer in these parts, so you better watch out if you ever need to chase something!\"\n\nAnd with a final playful grin and a quick dive, Dash swam off, leaving Howard with a sense of peace and a newfound appreciation for the value of compromise and empathy.\n\nThe moral of the story: Empathy dissolves hatred, and a little understanding can go a long way in resolving conflicts, even with the most unexpected of friends.", "llm_name": "CohereForAI/aya-23-8B", "llm_input_tokens": 135, "llm_output_tokens": 561, "llm_inference_time": 460.35023617744446, "host_provider": "endpoints.huggingface", "host_dc_provider": "eu-west-1", "host_dc_location": "eu-west-1", "host_gpu": "Nvidia A10G", "host_gpu_vram": 24, "host_cost_per_hour": 1.0, "generation_datetime": "2025-03-06 11:37:16", "pipeline_version": "1.0", "evaluation": {"type": "Fable Evaluation", "grammar": 9, "creativity": 6, "moral_clarity": 8, "adherence_to_prompt": 6, "best_age_group": "C", "explanation": ["The writing is clean, polished, and vivid, though the inclusion of proper names slightly detracts from the intended stylistic choice.", "The fable employs familiar animal characters and conventional dialogue, offering some original touches but largely following a predictable narrative pattern.", "The moral is clearly stated and meaningful, effectively linking empathy with the resolution of conflict.", "While the narrative covers most required elements, it strays from the prompt by naming the characters and not fully developing the bully persona.", "The vocabulary, sentence structure, and conceptual depth make it most appropriate for the 8-11 years age group."]}, "input_file": "tinyfabulist/data/fables/aya-23-8b-kzw/tf_fables_aya-23-8b-kzw_dt250306-112934.jsonl", "pipeline_stage": "evaluation", "evaluator_model": "o3-mini-2025-01-31", "evaluation_timestamp": "2025-05-06 07:35:37"}

A rival, a swift and cunning fox, had made a bold move, challenging Moose to a partnership. With a smile as sharp as their claws, the fox proposed a union, claiming their skills complemented each other perfectly. \n\nMoose, though wary, found themselves intrigued. After all, what knowledge could a quick-witted fox impart? So, they agreed to the partnership, a decision that would change their lives forever. \n\nAt first, the two creatures worked harmoniously, each bringing their unique skills to the table. Moose provided the strength to move heavy objects, and the fox offered their agility and cunning. They explored hidden chambers, uncovering forgotten treasures and ancient knowledge. \n\nHowever, as time passed, Moose began to sense the fox's true intentions. Small acts of betrayal and hidden agendas emerged, and Moose realized the fox only sought knowledge, devoid of understanding. Inflamed with anger and hurt, Moose confronted their rival, only to find words were like sharp fangs, piercing but not healing. \n\nIn a moment of frustration, Moose lashed out, speaking without thought. Words that should have been an apology instead became a declaration of their growth and newfound knowledge, an awareness of the fox's ignorance. \n\nAnd so, with a heavy heart, Moose left the fortress, their journey a testament to the power of knowledge outliving ignorance. \n\nThe Moral: \n\nIgnorance may offer comfort, but it is knowledge that empowers, and it is through understanding that true growth arises.", "llm_name": "CohereForAI/aya-23-8B", "llm_input_tokens": 135, "llm_output_tokens": 447, "llm_inference_time": 394.09073185920715, "host_provider": "endpoints.huggingface", "host_dc_provider": "eu-west-1", "host_dc_location": "eu-west-1", "host_gpu": "Nvidia A10G", "host_gpu_vram": 24, "host_cost_per_hour": 1.0, "generation_datetime": "2025-03-06 11:36:10", "pipeline_version": "1.0", "evaluation": {"type": "Fable Evaluation", "grammar": 8, "creativity": 6, "moral_clarity": 7, "adherence_to_prompt": 5, "best_age_group": "C", "explanation": ["The writing is polished and uses vivid descriptions fitting for a fable, with only minor issues that do not hinder understanding.", "The narrative employs imaginative settings and characters but relies on familiar animal archetypes and predictable plot turns.", "The moral is clearly stated and meaningful, though its integration with the character's development feels somewhat underdeveloped.", "While the fable includes key elements such as the eccentric moose, abandoned fortress, and a forced partnership, it omits an explicit apology letter read aloud, meaningful dialogue, and avoids using descriptive traits in place of actual names.", "The vocabulary, sentence structure, and conceptual themes make this fable most appropriate for children aged 8-11 years."]}, "input_file": "tinyfabulist/data/fables/aya-23-8b-kzw/tf_fables_aya-23-8b-kzw_dt250306-112934.jsonl", "pipeline_stage": "evaluation", "evaluator_model": "o3-mini-2025-01-31", "evaluation_timestamp": "2025-05-06 07:35:37"}

Please, just let me go.\" The ducks hesitated, and for a moment, Percepta thought they mightback down. But then, the white duck spoke, his voice cold as the night air. \"We will let you go...but you owe us a debt of gratitude.\" \n\nAnd with that, they turned and waddled back into the shadows, leaving Percepta alone by the twilight pond.

Ozelot, curious and adventurous, decided to explore this enigma.\n\nAs he meandered through the labyrinth, Ozelot encountered a group of small, wise-eyed rabbits. They seemed to be in a state of chaos, frantically running in circles and chattering anxiously.

It was a place where birds of prey ruled the skies, and a majestic cormorant, known for its insufferable arrogance, called it home. \n\nPerched atop the highest tower, this cormorant, with feathers as black as night and eyes as sharp as talons, gazed down upon the bustling fortress below. The fortress, a haven for all creatures great and small, was a place of wonder and unity. The birds worked together to tend to the needs of their community, ensuring all were well-fed and safe.\n\nHowever, this cormoran, with its insatiable appetite and arrogant nature, found fault with this harmonious existence. It believed that its superior hunting skills entitled it to the choicest prey, and so, it often snubbed its fellow birds, even going so far as to ignore the calls for help from those less fortunate.\n\nOne day, a small, wounded bird, with a broken wing, managed to make its way to the very top of the fortress, where our cormoran sat in all its arrogance. The wounded bird, in pain and despair, looked up at the cormoran with pleading eyes. \"Please, my friend,\" it said, \"I am but a humble companion, but I would offer you my last morsel of food in exchange for your aid.\"\n\nThe cormoran, with its nose in the air, replied, \"I care not for your pleas, little bird. I am above such things as kindness. I am destined for greater things, and my needs are beyond your understanding.\"\n\nAs the sun began its descent, casting long shadows across the land, the cormoran's heart, once so cold, began to stir. It felt a twinge of guilt as the bird's pleas echoed in its mind. \"I have so much, yet I am content with so little,\" it thought to itself.\n\nThe community, sensing the cormoran's change of heart, came together to rebuild the fortress, curing the broken wing and offering their assistance. In that moment, the cormoran realized that its true strength lay not in its arrogant nature, but in the unity and care it found within its community.\n\nThe moral of this fable is clear: caring for others is not an act of weakness, but of strength.

They loved to joke and laugh, and their playful nature often led to mischief. Walrus, always eager to fit in, found himself joining in on their pranks, even those that pushed the boundaries of what was acceptable. Little did he know that his disloyalty to his true nature would soon come back to bite him.\n\nAs the seals' pranks became bolder, Walrus found himself torn. He wanted to be beloved and accepted, but he also knew that his actions were causing a rift in the village. One day, their pranks went too far, and Walrus' conscience pricked sharply. He realized that his actions had caused hurt and that his disloyalty to his true self had created a deep divide among his fellow villagers.\n\nIn a moment of clarity, Walrus gathered the seals and, with gentle but firm voice, addressed them. \"My friends, I have caused hurt and division with my actions. I now see that my disloyalty to my true self has created wounds that need healing. Let us no longer seek acceptance through mischievous actions that harm. Instead, let us unite and create something that symbolizes our strength and unity.\"\n\nThe seals, intrigued and curious, listened intently. Walrus continued, \"Let us plant a tree together, a symbol of our unity and a reminder of the beauty that grows from healing and acceptance.\" The seals agreed, and with eager energy, they set to work, each contributing their unique skills to the task. Together, they dug a deep hole, mixed rich soil, and carefully planted an oak seed, tending to it with care and love.\n\nAs the tree grew, so did the bond between the villagers.

She had heard tales of a great warrior gorilla who had once guarded this bridge, protecting all who crossed with his strength and honor. The young gorilla wanted to meet this warrior and perhaps learn a thing or two about courage and wisdom. As she peered over the side, a great rumble caught her attention. The bridge was under attack! A team of wicked wolves, their eyes glinting with malicious intent, were trying to pull the bridge down, laughingly discussing how easy it would be to bring chaos to the forest. The young gorilla's heart raced. She knew she had to act, and so, with a brave smile, she leaped into action. Her first move was to gather the creatures who called the bridge home, offering them a chance to defend their home. Some joined with enthusiasm, others with reluctance, but together, they formed a peculiar team. The young gorilla, with her gullibility, managed to talk them into a plan. Using the wolves' own strength against them, they began to fortify the bridge, understanding that their unity was their greatest weapon. The wolves, confused by the strange alliance, grew frustrated and eventually retreated, defeated. In the aftermath, the young gorilla, now respected for her quick thinking, addressed her new friends. She thanked them for their courage and remembered the lessons she had learned: that every challenge presents an opportunity to learn and grow, and that unity and cooperation are the keys to overcoming adversity. They dedicated a memorial to the lost, a reminder of their strength, and the young gorilla, with a newfound sense of wisdom, continued on her path, sharing her tale with all who would listen.

They seemed concerned, pointing at something in the distance. As Squirt approached, she noticed a small, struggling fish, flailing in the shallows, unable to escape the sharp beaks of a flock of birds. \n\nWithout hesitation, Squirt leaped into action. She lunged toward the fish, using her powerful tail to push the birds away. The fish, now safe, swam toward the safety of the river.

What brings you so close to shore?\" \n\nSquirt, always honest, replied, \"I love the farm, and I can't resist the warmth of the sun here. But more than that, I want to help. I see your struggles, and I feel the need to contribute. Please, let me offer my strength for your benefit.\" The farmers were moved by her words and actions, and they welcomed her offer of help.

Here, the Moody Hawk, a formidable and mysterious bird, made its home. With a heart as sharp as its talons and an eye for the truth, the Hawk often found itself drawn to the pirate crew that called this cove their home. \n\nThe pirates were a diverse bunch, each with their unique skills and quirks. They had made a living sailing these waters, plundering and pillaging as they went. But their heart didn't truly lie in oppression and deceit. They were a band of dreamers, seeking freedom and adventure, even if it meant living on the edge of society. \n\nAmong them, a young pirate stood out. Let's call him the Deceiver. He had a way with words and a charm that could sway any audience. He knew how to spin a tale and create an illusion, often using these skills to get himself out of trouble. While the crew respected his wit, they also knew that his talents often led them into questionable situations. \n\nOne day, the crew received word of a lucrative treasure hidden on a nearby island. As they set sail, the Deceiver, ever the charmer, took it upon himself to lead the expedition. With a map in hand and a mischievous grin, he assured the crew that their journey would be a success. \n\nAs they approached the island, the Moody Hawk, ever observant, noticed something amiss. The Deceiver's map seemed to be missing key details, and his stories of the island's defenses were too good to be true. The Hawk, with its keen sense of justice, decided to follow the Deceiver's trail and uncover the truth. \n\nThe Hawk secretly observed the Deceiver as he interacted with the crew, his words and actions often contradicting each other. Finally, the truth was uncovered. The Deceiver had been deceiving not only the crew but also himself. In a dramatic confrontation, the Hawk unmasked the Deceiver's deception, revealing a heart starved for true adventure and freedom, not the false promises of opulence and power. \n\nThe crew, though disappointed in the Deceiver, respected the Hawk for its honesty and insight. They parted ways, each going their separate paths, but with a newfound understanding that truth and freedom go hand in hand. \n\nThe moral of this tale is that oppression, in any form, cannot silence the truth.

Their chatter and laughter filled the air. As Chroma approached, it saw that they were enjoying a feast of the most delicious-looking fruits it had ever laid eyes on.

But as they munched and chatted, a shadow fell over the happy gathering. A jealous slithery snake, slinking by, spied the feast and its envy grew with each step. It hissed, \"How dare they enjoy such delights while others starve! It's not fair!\"\n\nThe creatures' laughter faded, and their faces turned grave. Chroma, with its quick wit and gentle spirit, sensed the change in the air. \"My friends,\" it said, \"let us not be clouded by envy. There is enough joy and food for all.

They had noticed a change in the lagoon's behavior—a mysterious fog had begun to envelop the shallows at dusk, causing confusion and concern. The fish wanted to know if Persuasive had heard anything about this strange occurrence. \n\n\"Oh, my dear friends,\" Persuasive replied, her eyes sparkling with mischief. \"That fog is but a harmless mist, created by the moon's soft breath on the water. 'Tis a natural phenomenon, and 'tis beautiful, is it not?\" \n\nThe fish exchanged worried glances, for they knew that the moon could be a trickster at times, causing strange illusions. \"But why does it only appear at dusk?\" Goldfish asked, her fins twitching with curiosity. \n\nPersuasive's eyes widened as if struck by a brilliant notion. \"Ah, you see, my dear Goldfish, the moon's breath is a gentle reminder of the passing of time. It is a prompt to encourage us to reflect on our days and prepare for the night's rest. A time to ponder, a time to dream.\" \n\nThe fish nodded, finding solace in Persuasive's words. They thanked her for her wisdom and continued on their way, the fog now viewed with a sense of wonder and acceptance. \n\nYet, as the days passed, the fog returned, and Persuasive realized her mistake. She understood then that the mist was indeed a sign of trouble—a warning of a hidden danger lurking in the depths. \n\nDetermined to make amends, Persuasive embarked on a hero's journey, using her wit and charm to gather the lagoon's creatures and confront the threat.

The scorching sun beat down mercilessly, and the sand seemed to shift with every step, making Sneaky's journey even more challenging.

She heard the faintest of sounds carrying across the desert—a whispered secret that called to her. Intrigued, she followed the secret's voice, only to uncover a shameful truth.\n\nThere, in the heart of a sandstorm, she found a group of her fellow stoats, hiding from the world. They were not like the proud and independent creatures she had always known. These stoats were shameful and ashamed, hiding their true nature, for they were not like the other animals. They had been shunned and pushed away, and so they had built a secret den, a place where they could be themselves.\n\n\"Why are you here, Sneaky?\" hissed a voice, belonging to a stoat with a wise and weary gaze. \"This place is for those who can no longer hide their true nature. It is a place of shame and regret.\"\n\nSneaky's heart raced. She had always known she was different, but to see her kind hiding in plain sight, fearing the world's judgment, broke her heart. \"I am not like you,\" she replied, her voice steady despite her trembling body. \"I will not hide. I will face the world with my head held high.\"\n\nThe wise stoat smiled sadly. \"Then you must leave. This place is not for those who can embrace their true selves. But remember, once a secret is told, it is no longer a secret.\"\n\nAnd so, Sneaky bid farewell to the stoats she had never known.

Humility and perseverance are just as important. You must learn to adapt and find new ways to overcome your challenges.\"\n\nWith the owl's words ringing in her ears, Swift set out to explore the shipyard in a new light.

Her loyalty to the waterfall, a symbol of her community's harmony, clashed with her desire to explore and seek knowledge. She knew that any disruption to the waterfall could alter the delicate balance of their world forever. \n\n\"We must remember the value of harmony,\" she urged the community, her words carrying weight and wisdom beyond her years. \"The waterfall is a treasure, but so is our curiosity. Let us find a way to coexist and uncover the truth together.\" \n\nThe community listened, and a proposal was made: a grand festival, a celebration of their shared home, where all fireflies, guards, and explorers could come together and share their passions. On the night of the festival, the waterfall's light danced in harmony with the fireflies' luminescence, and the exploration fireflies shared their knowledge of the waterfall's secrets, revealing how their quest had only strengthened their appreciation for the beauty they sought to protect. \n\nThe truth, it seemed, stood the test of time, and the community's celebration was a testament to the power of unity and shared knowledge.

This woodpecker, let's call her Beak-a-Breeze, loved nothing more than exploring the nooks and crannies of the greenhouse, tapping away at the branches and leaves with her sturdy beak.

The once-vibrant colors of the flowers seemed to fade, and the gentle rustle of leaves now carried a hint of worry. Curious, she asked her friend, a wise old owl named Hootie Hoot, what was amiss.\n\nHootie Hoot shared the news that the festival, the event that brought their community together, was in jeopardy. A mysterious force had been at work, sabotaging the preparations. The once-glowing lights of the greenhouse were dimmed, and the gentle breeze that carried the scent of blooming flowers now seemed to whisper secrets of sadness.\n\nDetermined to brighten the mood, Beak-a-Breeze set out on a mission to bring peace and harmony back to their beloved greenhouse. She gathered her friends—a playful squirrel, a gentle butterfly, and a wise old tree—and shared her plan. Together, they decided to organize a new tradition, a gathering of peace and unity, to be held annually.\n\nOn the day of their gathering, the greenhouse buzzed with life once more. The creatures came together, each bringing their unique talent to the celebration. Beak-a-Breeze led the way with her cheerful song, a melody that lifted the spirits of all who heard it. The gathering was a success, and as the sun dipped below the horizon, the greenhouse shone with a new light—a light of compassion and understanding.\n\nFrom that day forward, the greenhouse became a sanctuary, a place where creatures from all corners of the garden gathered annually to celebrate their unity and the hidden beauty of compassion.
