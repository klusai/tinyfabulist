She was known for her bright smile and warm heart. One day, a harsh storm swept across the land, bringing cold winds and heavy rains. The pelican's friends, a family of rabbits and a wise old owl, huddled together for warmth.\n\nBut a fierce eagle, who often bullied the other birds, saw an opportunity to exploit the situation. She swooped down, threatening to steal their food and shelter. The pelican's friends were terrified. The pelican stood tall, though, and said, \"We won't let you scare us! We'll work together to find safety.\"\n\nTo everyone's surprise, the rabbit family and the owl agreed. Together, they gathered food and built a cozy shelter. The pelican's friends learned that even with their differences, they could protect each other from harm. The eagle, seeing the unity, began to feel ashamed of her past behavior. She joined the group, and they all shared what little food they had.\n\nAs the storm passed, the group celebrated their newfound friendship. They decided to create a special day to honor unity, where they would all come together to share food and stories. From that day on, the windswept plains were filled with laughter and warmth, and the joyful pelican's smile was contagious.\n\nThe pelican's friends looked at each other and said, \"When we're kind and work together, no one can oppress us!\" And the wise old owl added, \"Oppression sows rebellion, but kindness sows friendship.\" The joyful pelican nodded, her heart full of joy and her wings full of pride.", "llm_name": "meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct", "llm_input_tokens": 0, "llm_output_tokens": 0, "llm_inference_time": 12.208556175231934, "host_provider": "Hugging Face - Inference Endpoints", "host_dc_provider": "Amazon Web Services", "host_dc_location": "us-east-1", "host_gpu": "Nvidia L4", "host_gpu_vram": 24, "host_cost_per_hour": 0.8, "currency": "USD", "generation_datetime": "2025-05-08 11:53:55", "pipeline_version": "1.103.250508", "pipeline_stage": "fable"}
